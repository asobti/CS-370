#### Description ####

For this assignment, we were required to add several system calls to the
Linux kernel and test them.

The work was done on the linux kernel (ver. 2.6.22.19). 
Compilation was done on Tux, using gcc (ver. 4.6.3).
Versioning was done using Git, hosted on Github.

All implemented syscalls were tested using test programs we created (placed
in test_programs). As far as we can tell, all syscalls work as expected.

This was an interesting, and moderately challenging assignment. Since this
was our first exposure to the linux kernel, we did occassionally have to
google some issues we had, but we were able to figure everything out either
by reading articles on the web, or by reading the source code.
