#### Description ####

For this assignment, we were required  to implement a new scheduling policy that allocates equal CPU time to each user account.

The work was done on the linux kernel (ver. 2.6.22.19). 
Compilation was done on Tux, using gcc (ver. 4.6.3).
Versioning was done using Git, hosted on Github.
